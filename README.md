## Background
Volatility is a fundamental metric in modern finance. In this challenge, we use past volatilities and price changes of financial instruments to predict future volatility and control the risk of financial portfolios.
Here is [the video](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/stephane-mallat/Prediction-de-volatilite-de-marches-financiers-par-CFM.htm) of the challenge's presentation at Collège de France.

## Features

We have developed the Kairos package for predicting volatility. Kairos refers to an [ancient Greek diety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos). The word καιρός itself means *the opportune moment*.
